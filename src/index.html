<h2>
  Sendspin is an open standard for the complete music listening experience:
  listen, control & see.
</h2>

<p>
  <i>Sendspin is a work in progress. The specification is subject to change.</i>
</p>

<p>
  Sendspin is an open standard by the
  <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org" target="_blank"
    >Open Home Foundation</a
  >
  for a synchronized music experience across multiple devices and rooms. It
  enables speakers, lights, and screens to work together to create a rich and
  immersive audio environment:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play audio in sync across multiple speakers</li>
  <li>Visualize audio playback on connected lights</li>
  <li>Offer music control and metadata from tablets or screens</li>
</ul>

<h3>Try it out today</h3>

<p>
  Sendspin is actively being developed, and we have working implementations that
  we're using to test the specification and validate the experience we want to
  deliver.
</p>

<p>You can try a development version of Sendspin today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Stream music via Sendspin to any client using the beta version of
    <a href="https://www.music-assistant.io" target="_blank">Music Assistant</a>

    devices<sup>1</sup>.

<h3>Roles in a Sendspin network</h3>

<p>
  Sendspin supports different device roles to create a complete listening
  experience:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Speaker</b> – Any device that plays audio (speaker, phone etc.)</li>
  <li>
    <b>Visualizer</b> – Devices that visualize playback, such as LED strips,
    TouchDesigner plugin or a Winamp-style visualizers
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Remote</b> – Devices that display metadata and allow the user to control
    the music
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Why (yet another) new protocol?</h3>

<p>
  <b>Major audio-playback standards like AirPlay and Cast are closed.</b>
</p>

<p>
  We believe users should control their devices, their data,
  <i>and their music</i>. Open standards are essential to that vision. Existing
  protocols for synchronized audio experiences are proprietary and closed. This
  makes it impossible to have an open ecosystem of interoperable solutions that
  unleashes the creativity of the community.
</p>

<p>
  Sendspin is an open standard that takes a unique approach by focusing on the
  complete music listening experience. It goes beyond support for multi-room
  audio playback and supports remote controls and audio visualization out of
  the box.
