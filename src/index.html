<h2>
  Sendspin is an open standard for the complete music listening experience:
  listen, control & see.
</h2>

<p>
  <i>Sendspin is in public preview. The specification is subject to change.</i>
</p>

<p>
  Sendspin is an open standard by the
  <a href="https://www.openhomefoundation.org" target="_blank"
    >Open Home Foundation</a
  >
  for a synchronized music experience across multiple devices and rooms. It
  enables speakers, lights, and screens to work together to create a rich and
  immersive audio environment:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Play audio in sync across multiple speakers</li>
  <li>Offer music control and metadata from tablets or screens</li>
  <li>
    Visualize audio playback on connected lights
    <small>(coming soon)</small>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Try it out today</h3>

<p>
  Sendspin has been implemented in various products and projects to help
  validate the experience we want to deliver. We're actively working with the
  Open Home community to test the implementation, get feedback, and help shape
  the future of the protocol.
</p>

<h3>Why (yet another) new protocol?</h3>

<p>
  <b>Major audio-playback standards like AirPlay and Cast are closed.</b>
</p>

<p>
  We believe users should control their devices, their data,
  <i>and their music</i>. Open standards are essential to that vision. Existing
  protocols for synchronized audio experiences are proprietary and closed. This
  makes it impossible to have an open ecosystem of interoperable solutions that
  unleashes the creativity of the community.
</p>

<p>
  We also believe that existing standards are incomplete. They focus solely on
  audio streaming, while the complete music experience includes per-speaker DSP,
  controlling playback and visualizing the music. Sendspin aims to fill that
  gap.
